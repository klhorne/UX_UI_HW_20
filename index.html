        <!-- Goals & Objectives -->
        <h3>Goals & Objectives</h3>
        <p>
            To develop an app that allows travelers to enjoy and learn about popular tourist attractions of any nature—natural sites, historical, cultural, political, and more—without having to deal with the anxiety of group tours or having to use devices that others have touched in our post-pandemic world.

        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What can we do to make planning activities when traveling easier?</li>
            <li>How can we promote cultural and historical learning when traveling?</li>
            <li>What do users enjoy doing while traveling/on vacation?</li>
            <li>What are the pain points of planning activities when traveling?</li>
            <li>How do users feel about taking tours both self-guided and in-person?</li>

        <!-- Competitor Analysis -->
        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            GoBuddy has both direct and indirect competitors. There are many big names among them, including TripAdvisor, Airbnb Experiences, VoiceMap, and Wanderlog. A number of these apps allow travelers to book transportation, lodging, and experiences all at once. VoiceMap, in particular, offers self-guided audio tours. In spite of this, it lacks a user-friendly interface and does not offer group or private tours. There are a number of services offered by the other three competitors which can be overwhelming. In order to differentiate itself, GoBuddy specializes in creating experiences through tours but give users what they want when it comes to finding a variety of activities to partake in. This analysis helped me understand the market and how this product can succeed.

        <h2>Define & Ideate</h2>
    
        <!-- Persona: Meet Cassie -->
        <h3>Persona: Meet Cassie</h3>
        <p>
            A user persona was created based on the behavioral traits identified in my empathy map. Throughout the development process, it is essential to maintain a connection with the product user. Considering Cassie's pain points and goals, I focused on creating an application that allows her to discover new places at her own pace. I also included options to make connections when she's feeling social.
        </p>
    
        <!-- User Journey & Storyboard -->
        <h3>User Journey & Storyboard</h3>
        <p>
            I mapped out the Cassie’s journey via a storyboard. This allowed me to visualize her life and what interactions she will experience using GoBuddy.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Feature Prioritization -->
        <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on the user interviews and survey I analyzed what features are top priority. I determined that users need the ability to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Find activities based on location and preference</li>
                <li>Access curated travel content</li>
                <li>Ability to book a private tour guide</li>
                <li>Organize activities to make planning easier</li>
                <li>Purchase tours within the app</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    
        <!-- User Flow -->
        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p>
            After gaining a clear understanding of Cassie’s path, I focused on mapping out her happy path in a user flow.

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
    
        <!-- Feature Change -->
        <h3>Feature Change</h3>
        <p>
            In the first iteration, the option to create an account needs to be bigger and easier to see. I assumed users would want to sign in with their social networks, so I made this option smaller. Based on feedback, I added a Create Account button. I also added more social login options per their feedback.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            To enhance the search feature, I added trip details such as itinerary, price range, and the number of guests. Additionally, I discovered that I included too many filter options. As a result, I reorganized, retested, and narrowed down the filters.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
            This project taught me a lot about Design Thinking. During my journey, I learned how important it is to ask many "whys." In addition, I learned to refrain from making assumptions based on how I think users will interact with something rather than getting proof. I thought users would want an app focusing on producing quality self-guided tours, but after analyzing the data, I realized people like options - there is no one-size-fits-all answer.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Future Iterations -->
        <h3>Future Iterations</h3>
        <p>
            For future iterations, I would like to explore how users can use the app to make travel itineraries. I would have also liked to dive deeper into creating high-fidelity mockups and explore branding and visual design for the app.
